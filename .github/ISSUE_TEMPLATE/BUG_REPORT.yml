        ### 👍 Thank you for contributing to our project!
        Please note Nextcloud Server is a **free and open-source** project. Most people volunteer their own time to help you, so please, be patient as well as respectful of their time.
        This is **not** a technical support or general troubleshooting channel - you may never receive a direct response, but you report will be read by over 500 (!) maintainers and contributors.
        Someone **may** follow-up if more information is needed, but you **might not** receive a personal response. The priorities are: reviewing each report, triaging issues, and fixing known and reported bugs.
        If you use Nextcloud Server and it is critical to your mission, you may obtain [Enterprise support](https://nextcloud.com/support/) from Nextcloud GmbH or a [Nextcloud *certified* partner](https://nextcloud.com/partners/).
